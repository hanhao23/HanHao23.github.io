# Concepts

## The General Factor Of Intelligence

### Spearman's g
- Positive manifold

- Common variance among intelligence tests

--

### CHC Model
- The higher-order factor that accounts for common variance among broad ability factors

--

### g ~ 40-50% variance among intelligence tests

--

### Predictor of various outcomes

---
## Is g a psychological attribute?

### Yes (Spearman, 1904)
- The g factor is that it represents a general cognitive ability, or general intelligence (Gottfredson, 1997)

- Then what is this ability?

### Not necessarily (Thomson, 1916)
- The g factor may be merely an index of various cognitive abilities measured in an intelligence test. 

- g can emerge when multiple cognitive process are involved in the performance of tests and are sampled across a battery of tests.

- g is caused by **an overlap of processes** tapped by different tests.

## Process Overlap Theory (POT)
---
## Purpose

--

### Use simulation approach to demonstrate that the positive manifold can emerge from the covariance among test scores in the absence of a general cognitive ability.
--

### Demonstrate how broad abilities factors emerge from the introduction of a distinction between domain-general and domain-specific processes, and from the manipulation of the probabilities that each type of process is sampled by different types of tests.

---
## Summary Of simulation Procedure

--

### Specification of cognitive processes
- 4 types of processes: Executive function, fluid reasoning, verbal, spatial
- Orthogonal, from a standardized multivariate normal distribution
--

### Calculation of aggregate process abilite values
- Process Overlap Model (POT) vs. General Sampling Model (GSM)
--

### Simulation of item responses
- Multidimentional IRT function
- `\(a_{i} = 1\)` and `\(b_{i} = 0\)`
--

### Confirmatory factor analyses
- uni-factor model vs. higher-order model

## Basic Parameters

```r
# For reproduction purpose
set.seed(020)

# Sample size, num of subjects
np &lt;- 1000
# Number of tasks
nt &lt;- 9
# Items per task
ni &lt;- 100

# Number of Executive Functioning processes
ne &lt;- 50
# Fluid only processes
nf &lt;- 50
# Domain specific processes, Verbal and Spatial(Visual)
nv &lt;- 50
ns &lt;- 50
# Total number of all processes
nc &lt;- ne + nf + nv + ns
```
---
## Sampling Probabilities (GSM)

- We need to specify the numbers of processes that are being randomly sampled in a test.

- In GSM, no domains are specified when sampling the cognitive processes

- when performing any item from any of the 9 tasks , the probabilities of the 200 cognitive processes being sampled are all equal.

- In this GSM simulation, the probability is .10. Therefore for each item, a total of about 20 processes is sampled.


```r
# p of any process from the 200 being asampled in a test

pgs &lt;- .10
```
---
## Sampling Probabilities (POT)

- In POT, the probabilities are dependent on the test type and process type.

- Executive function processes should be sampled across any type of tasks, while domain-specific processes are aonly sampled in their relevant type of tasks.

- The probability of an exceutive function process being sampled in a fluid task is set higher than that in a verbal/spatial task

- For each item in the POT simulation, there is also a total of about 20 processes being sampled.


```r
# p of an E process being sampled in a domain general task 
*pef &lt;- .28
# p of a F process being sampled in a domain general task
pff &lt;- .12
# p of an E process being sampled in a domain specific task 
*pde &lt;- .12
# p of a V/S process being sampled in a domain specific task (V/S)
pds &lt;- .28
```

## Model Specification

- Both a uni-factor model and a higher-order model are specified for comparing the fits of POT data and GSM data


```r
# Uni-factor Model
o.model &lt;- '

  o =~ V1 + V2 + V3 + F1 + F2 + F3 + S1 + S2 + S3

'
# Higher-order model
g.model &lt;- ' 

  Verbal =~ V1 + V2 + V3 
  Fluid  =~ F1 + F2 + F3
  Spatial =~ S1 + S2 + S3 
  
  g =~ Fluid + Verbal + Spatial

'
```
