# Working Memory in Cognitive Individual Differences Research

## WM shows .redt[moderate-to-strong positive associations] with fluid intelligence (Gf) in many studies.

## WM tasks include attention/control or processing demands beyond simple storage, and outperforms STM tasks in .redt[predicting higher-order cognition] (like Gf performance).

## Individual differences in WM can predict real-world outcomes such as academic performance, everyday self-regulation, etc.

## WM deficits link to attention and cognitive disorders such as schizophrenia.

???
Point 3:
academic performance: reading, math, following complex instructions
self-regulation: keeping goals active, resisting distraction

### Ability to solve novel problems, reason, detect patterns (independent of prior knowledge)

- Measured by (abstract and "domain-free") reasoning tests (e.g., Raven's Matrices)

- Independent of prior knowledge, culture, language, etc.

- Has the strongest association with the general variances in human cognitive ability

- Strong predictor of academic and professional success

Does not address separate memory stores structure, but different states of memory representations.

WM = focus of attention + activated memory

- Focus of Attention: A very small amount of information we can directly “focus” on

- Activated Memory: A broader range of information being activated for rapid access

### .redt["Attention is all you need"]: Control of attention is central to working memory as a cognitive function.

# The WM–Gf Investigations

## r ≈ 0.5–0.8
- ### Working Memory Capacity usually share 30% to 60% of variance with Gf in empirical studies

## Why the association?
- ### Both require holding and manipulating info: WM may provide the "workbench" for reasoning
- ### The tasks shared reliance on attention control

## Raises question: .redt[What drives this link?] Domain-general components or dmain-specific components?

---

# The Domain-General/Specific Debate

## Domain-general View: A single, domain-general capability (e.g. attention control) limits all WM performances

## All WM tasks intercorrelate (a positive manifold), implying a common factor

- ### This general WM factor is thought to drive the WM–Gf relationship
 
## Executive Attention theory (Engle, 2005): WM capacity = ability to control attention (domain-general)

???
After:
The domain-generality view has had two important outcomes: WM training programs, and the investigations on the basis (both neurological and cognitive) of that generality in cognitive individual differences research.

---

# The Domain-General/Specific Debate

## Domain-Specific View: WM involve different mainenance/manipulation procedures or different "pools of resources".

- ### Verbal WM spans predicted verbal aptitude but not spatial ability (Daneman &amp; Tardif 1987; Shah &amp; Miyake 1996); however, this may be due to sample features (Kane et al., 2005)

## Tasks cluster by content: e.g. verbal spans inter-correlate more with verbal tasks than with spatial tasks; Factor analyses often yield multiple factors
- ### Verbal and visuospatial WM might be partly domain-specific; .redt[“central executive” isn’t the entire story]

???
Point 1:
Beyond a general capacity, modality-specific or process-specific resources limit performance (e.g. linguistic processing speed affects verbal span)

---

# The Measurements of WM

### Different theoretical models and perspectives of WM generally agree that WM is a complex, multi-faceted system with limited capacity.

### WMC should be measured by various tasks using different stimuli and/or paradigms.

### One task is never enough because each task taps WM plus task-specific processes (reading, math, speed, modality).

### We use task batteries to capture the common WM part and estimate the "task-bias-free" WM.

???
Before:
As you can tell from how I introduce both views, this is not a either-or case for the theoretical interpretations of WM, but more of the emphasis. And although they differ in emphases, different theoretical models and perspectives of WM generally agree that WM is a complex, multi-faceted system with limited capacity.

# The Measurement Problem of WM

## Every WM task = WM general demand(s) + non-general demands (reading skill, motor speed, visual search).

## Using more than one "family" helps us see what is shared across or specific to domains/modalities/tasks and avoid potential measurement problem of a single measure.

## But it is also why different WM theories sometimes look different in data: tasks emphasize different components.

???
After:
CSPAN tasks are mostly common in cog and individual difference research
NBack tasks are very popular in cog-neuro studies including brain imaging and EEG studies.
And other tasks are also not uncommon such as STM tasks and attention-related tasks

# Latent Variable Models to The Measurment Problem

.pull-left[
### Latent Factor (Variable): An inferred, unobserved construct that is assumed to cause performance on multiple tasks

- E.g. a high “General WMC” factor → high scores on all WM tasks
- The scores in one WM task is considered as a reflection of that .redt[latent] "General WMC"
- Collect the scores of people in lots of WM tasks and estimate the "General WMC" as a latent variable based on the observed scores.

### The latent measurement structure is represented by .redt[assumed] causal links from the factor to each task score (reflective model)

.pull-right[
![LVM](images/LVM1.png)
]

???
After: Benefits
Distills complex data into a few interpretable constructs
Handles measurement error; tests if a hypothesized structure fits data

---

# Structural Equation Models to The Complex Relationships

## The basic type of LVM (the measurement models) can be either exploratory or confirmatory
- ### For reliable and valid measurement structure .redt[we need both]

## Structural equation modeling (SEM) is used to test .redt[structrual relationships and assumptions] among observed and latent variables in a confirmatory, theory-driven fashion.

- ### Directional (Causal/Regressional)

- ### Non-directional (Correlational)

---

# Assumptions of LVM (&amp; SEM)

## Common Cause Assumption: Covariance among tests is attributed to one or more latent variables that .redt[“cause”] performance

- ### E.g. All WM tasks load on a common factor = assume a real underlying ability “WMC” producing those scores

## Common var = domain-general factor; Unique var = task-specific factors or measurement error

## Reflective Indications: The model implies if latent ability changes, all tasks change accordingly (.redt[arrows top-down])

# Latent Structure of WM (Hao et al., 2025)

## Rationale: Different fields and labs use different WM tasks (e.g. complex spans vs. n-back) and commonly refer them all as "WMC"; unclear if they tap the same or distinct abilities
- ### Also, debate on unitary vs. multi-component WM (domain-general vs. -specific)

## Approach: Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (EFA/CFA), + SEM regression to intelligence

## General Hypothesis: WM is multi-factorial (not a single factor), possibly reflecting distinct processes

# Interpretation

## WM is Multi-Faceted: Confirms that treating WM as a single number obscures important components, align with other recent investigations (e.g., Burgoyne et al., 2024)
- ### Three (or four) moderately related but distinct factors of WM
- ### A basic “storage” capacity vs. an executive control component vs. an updating component

## Both Domain-General and Specific:
- ### The moderate inter-factor correlations suggest an underlying general WM ability
- ### But the distinct factors also suggest domain-specific processes

???

Each factor captures unique variance within their task type for C-Span and n-Back tasks

---

# Interpretation

## Predicting *g* or Gf: Complex span and updating tasks are still especially diagnostic of fluid intelligence
## These tasks engage attention control and memory updating, which appear to be the mechanisms linking WM to reasoning
## "Storage" (not necessarily only STM) alone, when controlling for those, added little to explaining Gf
## C-Span and n-Back tasks generally surpass other behavioral "WM" tasks in neuroimaging research in predictive validity

.large[
# Take-Home (For Now)

## For comprehensive assessment of WM (or to predict cognitive performance), we must measure multiple components. Relying on one type of task could miss critical facets
## WM measured by complex span and n-Back tasks (even multiple tasks of the same paradigm) may still be conceptually different and should not be conceptualized interchangably
## Including both complex span and n-Back provides a more complete picture of an individual’s WMC
]


---

# Limitations of LVM &amp; SEM

## Imposed structure: Requires pre-specifying factor structure (which might miss nuanced relationships)
## Real cognition might not segregate neatly into independent factors
## Single-cause interpretation might over-simplify: Shared variance is treated as one latent “cause”, even if actual causation may be a complex system.
- E.g. A “General WM” factor could reflect many small process overlaps, not one capacity (Hao et al., 2025) 
## .redt[Latent Black Box]: Finding a factor doesn’t explain how tasks relate

???
Domain-specific interplay: SEM can include multiple factors, but often still assumes hierarchical structure rather than complex interdependencies

# (Psychometric) Network Model

## Different theoretical models can fit the same factor structure

## Network Approach: Complement SEM with a network analysis to explore direct relationships among tasks without assuming a latent cause

## (Psychometric) Network Model treats observed measures/scores as nodes in a network, connected by edges representing direct statistical associations

# (Psychometric) Network Model

## A Network Model treats observed measures/scores as nodes in a network, connected by edges representing direct statistical associations

---
# Features of Network Models

## Typically use partial correlations: correlation between two tasks’ scores controlling for all others  
## Interpretation: An edge indicates two tasks share a unique relationship not explained by other tasks
## If no edge between tasks A and B (after model selection): any (negliable) association between A and B is "mediated" by other tasks in the network

---

# Contrast with LVM

## No latent common cause is assumed and acknowledge complex systems

## The pattern of connections can reveal clusters of tasks and bridging tasks

# Implications on WM Research

## Assessment: Use diverse WM tasks and design batteries with multiple WM components
## Theory: Move beyond unitary assumption and interpret causal links as multi-route
## Training &amp; Applications: Target both general and specific processes
## Big Picture: Embrace complexity in cognitive functions and system
